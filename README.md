# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a course assignment to implement part of the logic for a Tic-Tac-Toe game on an NxN game board (e.g. 4x4, 5x5, etc).
The program randomly fill the board with 'X', 'O', print the board, determine if there are any winning combinations of the same value (X,O) across a row, down a column, or diagonal.
